- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rngpinto


I am a Project Manager Professional with 8 yearsâ€™ experience in project management and proficient both with Waterfall and Agile methodologies.
I have always worked with projects and I love translating ideas and requirements into project deliverables.

My other main interest is data and analyzing datasets to deliver meaningful insights from numbers and attributes. I am always looking at ways to find more important breakthroughs from data and dealing with new challenges to improve businesses with data driven insights. I have concluded in June 2022 a Postgraduate course in Data Analysis for Business.


About my hobbies, I love travelling, listening to music and going to the cinema.
