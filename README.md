- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rngpinto


I am a Project Manager Professional with 8 yearsâ€™ experience in project management and proficient both with Waterfall and Agile methodologies.
I have always worked with projects and I love translating ideas and requirements into project deliverables.

I have hands-on experience in collecting requirements, managing client facing projects and working on cross-functional teams.
I also have the ability to be flexible, follow tight deadlines and independently organize and prioritize work, while managing communication and several stakeholders (internal and external) at multiple levels of the organization.


My other main interest is data and analyzing datasets to deliver meaningful insights from numbers and attributes. I am always looking at ways to find more important breakthroughs from data and dealing with new challenges to improve businesses with data driven insights.

I am currently attending a postgraduate course in Data Analysis for Business (on evening), which is ending on June 2022.


About my hobbies, I love travelling, listening to music and going to the cinema.
