- 👋 Hi, I’m @rngpinto


I am a Project Manager Professional (PMP)® with 8 years’ experience in project management and proficient both with Waterfall and Agile methodologies.
I have always worked with projects and I love translating ideas and requirements into project deliverables.

My other main interest is Data and Business Intelligence, e.g. analyzing datasets to deliver meaningful insights from numbers and attributes, elaborating predictive analysis through econometric models and translating important information into effective visualization.
I am always looking at ways to find more important breakthroughs from data and dealing with new challenges to improve businesses with data driven insights. 

I have concluded in June 2022 a Postgraduate course in Data Analysis for Business.


About my hobbies, I love travelling, listening to music and going to the cinema.
